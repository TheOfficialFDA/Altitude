# Alititude 
Hey, so today I'm bringing you guys an easy to use program that does:

- Open the DynMaps easily.
- Open all 6 voting sites, with one click!


# Future Plans

- [x] Dynmaps
- [x] Easy access to voting sites
- [ ] Implementing Shardians Website 
- [ ] Save a username, and check on program start if a user has voted.
- [ ] Add a feedback box, that works with a discord webhook directly for user feedback to help improve the program.

# Credits

I would like to credit Shardian for helping me work on this project, he's been a big help, and I've been learning a lot just talking with him.
